## Contributing

If you want to add features or bugfixes, please open an issue (either feature or bug) and provide also an unittest (https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest).
To make things easier, you can use Taskfile (https://taskfile.dev/) to get a small shortcut for some useful commands.

You also need to copy the ".env-template" file as ".env" and configure it for your needs.

The Taskfile itself needs this tools to run the tasks:
