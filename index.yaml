    description: jDownloader2 Helm chart for Kubernetes. "JDownloader is a free, open-source
      download management tool with a huge community that makes downloading as easy
      and fast as it should be. Users can start, stop or pause downloads, set bandwith
      limitations, auto-extract archives and much more. It's an easy-to-extend framework
      that can save hours of your valuable time every day!"
